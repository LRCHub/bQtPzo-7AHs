[00:22.65] At home drawing pictures
[00:25.57] Of mountain tops
[00:28.02] With him on top
[00:30.62] Lemon yellow sun
[00:32.52] Arms raised in a V
[00:35.54] And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
[00:56.04] 
[00:42.47] Daddy didn't give attention
[00:45.82] Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
[00:50.33] King Jeremy the wicked
[00:54.93] Oh, ruled his world
[01:04.43] 
[00:59.91] Jeremy spoke in class today
[01:08.87] Jeremy spoke in class today
[01:22.37] 
[01:19.83] Clearly I remember
[01:20.33] Pickin' on the boy
[01:23.84] Seemed a harmless little fuck
[01:26.39] But we unleashed the lion
[01:31.36] Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
[01:56.36] 
[01:34.90] How could I forget
[01:37.54] And he hit me with a surprise left
[01:41.59] My jaw left hurting
[01:43.98] Dropped wide open
[01:47.18] Just like the day
[01:50.08] Oh, like the day I heard
[02:02.08] 
[01:51.60] Daddy didn't give affection, no
[02:00.03] And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
[02:03.47] King Jeremy the wicked
[02:07.97] Oh ruled his world
[02:16.97] 
[02:13.17] Jeremy spoke in class today
[02:22.21] Jeremy spoke in class today
[02:31.35] Jeremy spoke in class today
[02:44.85] 
[02:48.32] Try to forget this (try to forget this)
[02:52.67] Try to erase this (try to erase this)
[02:57.01] From the blackboard
[03:06.51] 
[03:07.35] Jeremy spoke in class today
[03:16.48] Jeremy spoke in class today
[03:29.98] 
[03:25.63] Jeremy spoke in
[03:27.89] Spoke in
[03:29.85] Jeremy spoke in
[03:32.27] Spoke in
[03:34.41] Jeremy spoke in class today
